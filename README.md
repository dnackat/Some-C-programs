**Hello there!**

**These are some C programs I wrote for a class. Here's an overview of what these programs were written for:**

**- Calculating the lowest number of coins required for a given change amount**

**- Checking the validity of credit cards (Luhn's algorithm)**

**- Cracking 5 letter alphabetical passwords (encrypted with C's own DES)**

**- Generating music using ASCII-ised versions of notes and durations**

**- Resizing BMP images**

**- Recovering JPEG files from a raw image of a FAT-32 based file system**

**- Spell check a text file (using a specified dictionary file) using a hash table implementation.**
