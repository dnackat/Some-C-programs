**Hello there!
These are some C programs I wrote for a class. Here's an overview of what these programs were written for: Calculating the lowest number of coins required for a given change amount, checking the validity of credit cards (Luhn's algorithm), cracking 5 letter (alphabetical passwords, encrypted with C's own DES), generating music using ASCII-ised versions of notes and durations, resizing BMP images, recovering JPEG files from a raw image of a FAT-32 based file system, spell check a text file (using a specified dictionary file) using a hash table implementation.**
