# Hello there!

## These are some programs I wrote for CS50 (Harvardx). Here's an overview of what these programs were written for:  
  
  ### C

- Calculating the lowest number of coins required for a given change amount

- Checking the validity of credit cards (*Luhn's checksum*)

- Cracking 5 letter alphabetical passwords (*encrypted with C's own DES*)

- Generating music using `ASCII`- ised versions of notes and durations

- Resizing `BMP` images

- Recovering `JPEG` files from a raw image of a `FAT`- based file system

- Spell check a text file (using a specified dictionary file) using linked lists and a hash table  
    
### Python/JavaScript/Ajax (with HTML/CSS/Jinja2)  
 
- Creating a website for checking similarities between two files line-wise, sentence-wise, or based on substrings of a specified length (_HTML/CSS/Jinja2 front-end, Python/Flask back-end_)  
  
- Creating a dummy share trading webiste where users can register; login and logout; quote, buy, and sell shares; and browse
through their transaction history (_HTML/CSS/Jinja2 front-end, Python/Flask back-end with SQLite Database_)  
  
- Creating a web app that lets users search for top articles from Google news atop a map using city name and state or a zipcode 
(_HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery front-end with Ajax to return articles as JSON objects, Python/Flask back-end with SQLite Database_)
